# webgl-ducks
This WebGL project was built using [Edward Angel's framework](https://github.com/esangel/WebGL) that he created to go along with his book *Interactive Computer Graphics: A Top-Down Approach With Shader-Based Opengl*.

The duck/human objects are rendered in through recursive functions- each traversing through a list of nodes created by each object's respective "initNodes" function.

To build the project- first clone the repository for Angel's framework and place the webgl-ducks HTML/JS files in the appropriate path defined by the script tags (lines 66 - 69) of "webgl-ducks.html".
